# ProcastinationKiller
A simple console application that scans the RAM and kills the .exes that the user requested.

Usage: The app will ask you the name of the app you want to kill and the time that this app will stay in the background.

WARNINGS:


-Save whatever you're doing with the target app because this app doesn't care about what you're doing, it will simply kill it when there's an instance of it running.


-This is an "0.01", it's really rough, but if I see that people like it, I might upgrade it to a fully fledged app.


-If you want to kill multiple apps at once, execute this multiple times(yes, I know).


-For the purpose of being harder to kill, you can only kill it via the task killer.
